# A simple youtube video summarization script. 

## You can change the prompt as you like in the code.

Installation steps:

1. ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
2. ```python summarizer.py```
3. Profit!

Oh, also, if you have a transcript generated(transcript.txt), delete it if you want a new video, 
the reason I added it is so that you could modify the prompt and play around with what you like.

Cheers!
